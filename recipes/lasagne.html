    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
    <li>brown onion (finely diced)</li>
    <li>garlic cloves (minced)</li>
    <li>beef mince</li>
        <li>tomato paste</li>
        <li>tinned tomatoes (diced or crushed)</li>
        <li>beef stock (liquid)</li>
        <li>dried italian herbs(eg:parsley and oregano)</li>
        <li>cheeses (eg:mozzarella, parmesan)</li>
        <li>lasagne sheets</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Saut√© the onion and garlic until soft and translucent in a large pan</li>
        <li>Add the beef mince, breaking up the clumps with a spoon, and cook until the mince is browned</li>
        <li>Add the tomato paste, tomatoes, beef stock, Italian herbs and salt and pepper, and bring to a boil and then simmer (stirring occasionally) for 15 - 20 minutes</li>
        <li>Assemble the lasagne by adding a layer of sauce to the bottom of the prepared baking dish, and top with fresh lasagne sheets and then shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>Repeat the layers until you have used all of the sauce and lasagne sheets</li>
        <li>Finish with a layer of mozzarella cheese and add a sprinkle of grated parmesan over the top</li>
        <li>Bake in a preheated oven for 30-40 minutes or until cooked through and the cheese has melted and turned golden on top</li>
        <li>Tip: If you notice the cheese over-browning too much, add a loose sheet of foil over the top or move to a lower shelf in the oven</li>
    </ol>
